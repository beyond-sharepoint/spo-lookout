Interactive administration tool to monitor and interact with SharePoint.

[Demo](https://beyond-sharepoint.github.io/sp-lookout/#/)

>Note: The demo site changes frequently, if you find that it doesn't load, clear your IndexedDB in dev tools -> application

Host locally/develop: 

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Dependencies (npm install)
3. Via SharePoint, Upload HostWebProxy.aspx from /public to https://[YourTenant]/Shared%20Documents/
4. Start with npm start


Goals:

1. Provide Dashboard functionality to monitor SharePoint at a glance.
2. Provide insight into SharePoint via Charts and Data Views
3. Provide ui for common tasks (JSLink, etc)
4. Provide fiddle to easily call SP REST services from the tool
5. Allow all of the above to be configurable (and shareable)
